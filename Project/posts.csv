This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

4,zjvm4a,What was your favourite race weekend of the season and why?,"The 2022 F1 season was the first with the new regulations designed to improve wheel-to-wheel racing and it surely delivered. Among the 22 race weekends we had this season, which was your favourite, considering the events that occurred throughout qualifying, sprint (wherever applicable) and the race?

My personal favourite was Silverstone. A superb wet qualifying where Sainz took his first pole position, followed by a great race. The safety car restart at the end was one of the most entertaining pieces of racing I've witnessed in modern F1. Although as a Ferrari fan I was a bit sad that we missed out on a 1-2, we still got to enjoy a great spectacle.

An honourable mention would be Brazil, where in yet another semi-wet qualifying session, Magnussen took a surprising pole position, and Interlagos, like last year, delivered pretty much the only entertaining sprint race of the year. The main race was also fun, with Russell taking his first win, Leclerc pulling off a great recovery drive and the red bull team radio drama.","What was your favourite race weekend of the season and why?

Sebastian Vettel, who was driving for Ferrari and was behind Alonso when the crash happened, felt the crash ""looked strange"", estimating that the McLaren's speed was only around 150kph (or just over 93mph), and that Alonso turned right into the wall.[4] GPS measurements from other teams indicate that Alonso lost control at 135km/h, and crash at 105km/h.[5] It was not significantly damaged from the impact, but required analysis of its gearbox and power unit systems, preventing Button from driving it that afternoon.[6]

However, concern began to emerge when Alonso was seemingly unable to exit the cockpit. Medical crew rushed towards his stricken McLaren, where they performed first aid and airlifted him to hospital.[7] According to McLaren, the crash was simply the result of unpredictable gusty winds, and claimed on 23rd February that Alonso was recovering well in hospital and his condition was normal. It also refuted that the McLaren had any mechanical failures.[8] Overtime however, insiders of the sport noted that this testing accident was anything but normal, with Alonso not only being required to spend three nights in hospital, but also faced having to withdraw from the Australian Grand Prix, being replaced by Kevin Magnussen. It was later determined that Alonso had suffered from a concussion, as he suffered two blows to his head from the collision and that doctors were recommending he should limit his activity to avoid risking second impact syndrome.[9] Alonso would return for the Malaysian Grand Prix,[10] and competed in the rest of the season.

Rumours and Theories regarding the Crash
In the days and weeks following the crash, numerous rumours and theories emerged questioning the official narrative of the accident. These were fuelled when during an interview prior to the Malaysian Grand Prix, Alonso claimed that his car suffered from locked steering and refuted his team's wind explanation, responding that ""Even a hurricane would not move the car at that speed.""[11] The lack of information being released following the accident, the fact the McLaren was not severely damaged from the impact yet was withdrawn from further testing, as well as McLaren's explanations being belated and also claimed as inaccurate, led to the crash being deemed a mystery and leading to speculation over what actually happened.[12]

One theory circulated that because Honda, who had recently returned to the sport, had been experiencing troubles with its electronic energy-recovery systems that Alonso either ended up becoming unconscious or drowsy from inhaling toxic battery fumes, or was even victimised by an electric shock. Both McLaren and Alonso's manager Luis Garcia Abad denied these claims, and again blamed gusty wind, with some noting that Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz had also crashed at Turn 3 for which he blamed high, inconsistent wind.[13]

Another theory suggests that Alonso was knocked out due to the unusual physical circumstances behind the crash. It is proposed that the car headed towards the wall at a sharp angle, before straightening out in the grass, meaning the car hit the wall with a large amount of momentum. The car supposedly hit at a flat, parallel angle to the wall. In a more traditional open wheel crash, the suspension and other parts of the car easily detach and deform, dissipating energy before it reaches the driver. The suspension on the cars can easily be twisted and snapped off, however it requires a lot more force to compress this suspension in a direct hit. It is theorized because of the flat angle of which the car impacted, the suspension held strong and the energy travelled through the suspension. In conclusion, this theory proposes that between the force from the impact angle, that lack of car deformation, and the concrete walls lack of deformation compared to that of a tire barrier, resulted in Alonso's body taking the brunt of the impact.

What was also unusual was that in McLaren's Day 4 test report, McLaren claimed Alonso was uninjured, yet later on in the same document, racing director Eric Boullier revealed Alonso was concussed.[14][15] This also conflicted with team boss Ron Dennis' comments in a press conference that Alonso merely suffered from the symptoms of a concussion. Other theories then emerged claiming Alonso suffered from far worse than a concussion, with some like Ralf Bach of Sport Bild and TZ Munchen and El Pais reporting that Alonso was suffering from memory loss. Particularly, Bach claimed that Alonso's memory loss led him to believe he was still at Ferrari and ended up speaking Italian. Meanwhile, El Pais wrote that Alonso thought he was 13, telling doctors ""I'm Fernando. I race karts and I want to be a Formula One driver"", and that he needed a week to fully regain his memories.[16] Alonso denied these rumours in the same interview prior to the Malaysian Grand Prix.[17]

By May 2015, the mystery was still deemed unresolved by some insiders. Ultimately, without any footage from the crash, telemetry data, nor the findings from the FIA's investigation being publicly released, some like Sky Sports F1 concluding that the accident would never be fully explained.[18]""

- A number of F1 drivers have won 24 hour races, but none comes close to the achievement of Helmut Marko and Gérard Larrousse who won the *86* Hours of Nürburgring endurance race in 1970. For good measure, Helmut won a support race just before the 4 day marathon and flew off to Sweden to finish 2nd in another race just one day after the finish.

- Teo Fabi scored three pole positions but never led a lap in his 64-race F1 career.

- Williams holds the record for the most constructor points (66) in a single race, scored by Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas at the 2014 Abu Dhabi GP. This was the only race with F1's experimental double points.

14,zhykua,Analysis: What happened to Vettel's qualifying pace after announcing retirment?,"As we know, Sebastian Vettel announced retierment at the 13th round of the 2022 F1 season. I myself closely watched him this year and was intrigued by his performances pre and post this decision. Specifically in regards to qualifying, I believe his Sunday pace did not change much but that his Saturday pace certantily did.

It is also been interesting that he got rated highly in the 2nd half but quite mediocrely in the 1st half where the numbers suggest he heavily underperformed on one lap pace in the 2nd half while doing very well in the 1st. This I believe might be some huge car-bias at play. In the 1st half he was very strong in all areas of racing but had a backmarker car, in the 2nd half he was highly lacking in qualifying but had a legit midfield contender car.

Anyway, let's get to it.

Vettel missed the first 2 rounds so the comparison will start with round 3.

&#x200B;

|Round (GP)|% Gap to teammate|Context + track conditions|
|:-|:-|:-|
|3 (Australia)|NaN|Stroll crashed out of qualifying. Session given to Vettel by infinite size.|
|4 (Imola)|\-10,208|Stroll made a mistake on their 1st and only run in Q2 before rain came.|
|5 (Miami)|\+0,242||
|6 (Spain)|\-0,573||
|7 (Monaco)|\-0,498||
|8 (Azerbaijan)|NaN|Vettel was 1 second faster on their 1st runs, on their 2nd Stroll crashed. Session given to Vettel by infinite size.|
|9 (Canada)|\-1,079|Track was wet.|
|10 (Britain)|\-0,744|Track was wet.|
|11 (Austria)|\+0,353|Vettel had his 0,4% quicker lap deleted to track limits. Driver error not accounted for.|
|12 (France)|\-0,165||
|13 (Hungary)|\+0,086||
|14 (Belgium)|\+0,083||
|15 (Netherlands)|NaN|Vettel and others had their last Q1 laps ruined by Stroll kicking dirt onto the last corner. Stroll looked to be a few hundreths quicker but session excluded as non driver fault knocked a driver out in Q1.|
|16 (Italy)|\-0,136||
|17 (Singapore)|\+0,148|Track was wet.|
|18 (Japan)|\-0,179||
|19 (Usa)|\+0,381||
|20 (Mexico)|\-0,126||
|21 (Brazil)|\-0,742|Track was wet.|
|22 (Abu Dhabi)|\-0,453||

Those are the numbers over the whole season, now I will break them down into 3 different categories, pre-retirment, post-retirment and the last 3 weekends where Vettel seemed very motivated to do his best in his last month as an F1 driver. The last one i a bit arbitrary to cut it off at just those last 3 weekends but it really did seem to me that he had the motivation he was lacking before in that last month.

**Round 3-12 (Australia-France):**

Vettel had a median qualifying gap to his teammate of **-0,659%** and a h2h at **8-2**. Australia was a weird session, excluding that one the gap is **-0,573%**.

**Round 13-19** **(Hungary-Usa)**

For this period Vettel was **outqualified** by his teammate, the gap was **+0,085%** and the h2h2 was at **2-4**.

**Round 20-22 (Mexico-Abu Dhabi)**

In the last 3 weekends Vettel's 1st half qualifying form came back, the gap here was **-0,453%** and the h2h was at **3-0**.

**In conclusion**

Vettel lost 5 tenths in qualifying for 6 rounds until rediscovering his pace with new found motivation.

There are 3 things from this post that interests me a bit.

1. It shows how much media and fan ratings are connected to how good a car a driver is piloting.
2. How the end of a drivers career effects the performace of said driver, seemingly atleast in Sebastian Vettel's case severly hampering qualifying pace, but not doing much to damage race pace, w2w, race craft and performance in rain sessions.
3. Aston Martins car was very much an underrated car for qualifying due to those 6 straight qualifyings where Vettel was leaving ca 5 tenths on the table. Not that they didn't have issues with tyre warming and Saturday performance but Vettel made the problem look worse then it was, he showed when he was at it that the car had no problems reaching Q2 easily and Q3 half of the time.

**Edit:**

As u/Astelli made clear, not writing down my methodology in the post was a bad move. Without that I'm not telling how I got the numbers as I did.

**Methodology**

There are 3 rules I apply when doing qualifying analysis, there isn't any right or wrong way to do it and different people do it in different ways.

1. I use the median and not an average, this means it is the middle value of a set of data that gets used. This treats every session as equal and insures that a very big gap in one session won't skew the result. It also means I will consitently be able to apply my own rules for every session and allows for little bias.
2. If a driver crashes then their teammate gets a gap of infinite size, this is to avoid smaller mistakes being punished while a much bigger mistake in crashing out is discarded or even rewarded in the case of it impeding their teammates lap. This is another reason I use the median as it allows for setting an infinite size as all that does is push the middle value by one notch. There is one problem with this, it means that sometimes we aren't actually calculating the pace difference between two drivers. But this is a relatively small problem and very rarely makes an actual substantial difference to the end result, it usually changes the final value by a hundreth or so.
3. Usually I discard rain session, this is when I do a cross-comparison, because different seasons have dramatically different amounts of rain effected sessions a driver consistently good in those conditions would do much better in one season on the whole then another. 2019 had no wet sessions for example, 2014 had five, comparing two teammate pairings from those years with eachother and including wet sessions would not be a one-to-one comparison.","Analysis: What happened to Vettel's qualifying pace after announcing retirment?

The last one i a bit arbitrary to cut it off at just those last 3 weekends but it really did seem to me that he had the motivation he was lacking before in that last month.

**Round 3-12 (Australia-France):**

Vettel had a median qualifying gap to his teammate of **-0,659%** and a h2h at **8-2**. Australia was a weird session, excluding that one the gap is **-0,573%**.

**Round 13-19** **(Hungary-Usa)**

For this period Vettel was **outqualified** by his teammate, the gap was **+0,085%** and the h2h2 was at **2-4**.

**Round 20-22 (Mexico-Abu Dhabi)**

In the last 3 weekends Vettel's 1st half qualifying form came back, the gap here was **-0,453%** and the h2h was at **3-0**.

**In conclusion**

Vettel lost 5 tenths in qualifying for 6 rounds until rediscovering his pace with new found motivation.

There are 3 things from this post that interests me a bit.

1. It shows how much media and fan ratings are connected to how good a car a driver is piloting.
2. How the end of a drivers career effects the performace of said driver, seemingly atleast in Sebastian Vettel's case severly hampering qualifying pace, but not doing much to damage race pace, w2w, race craft and performance in rain sessions.
3. Aston Martins car was very much an underrated car for qualifying due to those 6 straight qualifyings where Vettel was leaving ca 5 tenths on the table. Not that they didn't have issues with tyre warming and Saturday performance but Vettel made the problem look worse then it was, he showed when he was at it that the car had no problems reaching Q2 easily and Q3 half of the time.

**Edit:**

As u/Astelli made clear, not writing down my methodology in the post was a bad move. Without that I'm not telling how I got the numbers as I did.

**Methodology**

There are 3 rules I apply when doing qualifying analysis, there isn't any right or wrong way to do it and different people do it in different ways.

1. I use the median and not an average, this means it is the middle value of a set of data that gets used. This treats every session as equal and insures that a very big gap in one session won't skew the result. It also means I will consitently be able to apply my own rules for every session and allows for little bias.
2. If a driver crashes then their teammate gets a gap of infinite size, this is to avoid smaller mistakes being punished while a much bigger mistake in crashing out is discarded or even rewarded in the case of it impeding their teammates lap. This is another reason I use the median as it allows for setting an infinite size as all that does is push the middle value by one notch. There is one problem with this, it means that sometimes we aren't actually calculating the pace difference between two drivers. But this is a relatively small problem and very rarely makes an actual substantial difference to the end result, it usually changes the final value by a hundreth or so.
3. Usually I discard rain session, this is when I do a cross-comparison, because different seasons have dramatically different amounts of rain effected sessions a driver consistently good in those conditions would do much better in one season on the whole then another. 2019 had no wet sessions for example, 2014 had five, comparing two teammate pairings from those years with eachother and including wet sessions would not be a one-to-one comparison.","['Analysis', ':', 'What', 'happened', 'to', 'Vettel', ""'s"", 'qualifying', 'pace', 'after', 'announcing', 'retirment', '?', 'As', 'we',

18,zh26ra,USGP Price Comparison as a Local Race Fan,"Love F1 and COTA, but this pricing has now hit absurd levels. For the same price as going to the USGP, I can now go to MotoGP and NASCAR for the next 3 years!

I even added the local Speed Tour event, which gives PADDOCK ACCESS to US F4 and US FR and other races for $50 the whole weekend. There's just too much good racing out there to blow $750 (+taxes/fees) on an overcrowded general admission.

Note: These are all for the races at COTA

Note 2: This is less about price and whether people can afford it or not. It's about VALUE... you're getting the same experience as 2021 at over double the price. You can watch other professional races at the same venue for a fraction of the price and hassle.

 - This would satisfy everyone complaining about all overtakes being thanks to DRS but would still create overtakes, just in the corners;
 - It would also encourage better racing in terms of re-overtaking: if a driver wants to overtake, they’ll have to use more battery than usual which will leave them vulnerable on the next straight.

28,zgppce,An extended points system visualized,"Over the past two days posts such as [Average finishing positions for the 2022 season](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/zf6a02/average_finishing_positions_for_the_2022_season/) and [Why don’t all finishing positions get points?](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/zfqzka/why_dont_all_finishing_positions_get_points/) have sparked debate about rewarding drivers who consistently finish just outside the points. This piqued my curiosity, and I went ahead and simulated the 2022 season results with an extended point system to see if such changes would better reflect driver performance.

In 2010, the points system currently in use was adopted, primarily to reward [going for race wins](https://web.archive.org/web/20100205194652/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/f1releases/2010/Pages/f1_comm_0210.aspx), and in my opinion, it was well adjusted for the reliability of those cars as well as the field spread. From 2019 onward, one point was awarded for the fastest lap set during the race, provided the driver finished in the top 10.

After trying different points systems that went down to P12, P13 and P14, I eventually settled on a points system that went down to P12 with one point for fastest lap.

|Position|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points|25|20|16|14|12|10|8|6|4|3|2|1|

The system retains the existing point system for the sprint race.

**The adjusted drivers' standings would look like:**

Changes:

* Not necessarily a change but Charles Leclerc and Sergio Perez are level on points, with Leclerc beating Perez on count back (3 wins vs 2 wins)
* Lewis Hamilton ahead of Carlos Sainz.
* Sebastian Vettel ahead of Daniel Ricciardo.
* Pierre Gasly and Lance Stroll ahead of Kevin Magnussen.
* Yuki Tsunoda ahead of Mick Schumacher.

**The adjusted constructors' standings would look like:**

[Adjusted Constructors' Standings](https://preview.redd.it/e8m42e5u6t4a1.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3ad29301d89ea7163babbb32d03ee2d8d7fe9b8)

Changes:

* Aston Martin ahead of Alfa Romeo.
* AlphaTauri ahead of Haas.

&#x200B;

**Takeaways:**

* Everyone scored points! The same is not the case when this adjusted points system is applied to the 2020 and 2021 seasons.
* Aston Martin duo score more points due to their consistency. Sebastian Vettel jumps ahead of Daniel Ricciardo by a small margin. Lance Stroll scores 40% of the teams points as opposed to 33% without the adjustment. This better represents his average race finish position, and he appears closer to Sebastian Vettel in terms of points scored.
* Aston Martin jumps Alfa Romeo in the standings, but this is because of a bump in points collected by Sebastian Vettel, as Zhou Guanyu bridges the gap and is level on points with Mick Schumacher. Zhou Guanyu scores 20% of the teams points as opposed to only 10% with the current points system. This more accurately reflects his race finishing position.
* Haas's inconsistency costs them points, with both drivers losing championship positions to more consistently scoring drivers. Barring some high points finishes, especially at the beginning of the season, Haas have a low average race finish with both drivers.
* Performance gap between Williams' duo is more evident, with Albon scoring 4x more points than the actual (largest % increase with extended points system) and over 3x more than his teammate.  


**Conclusion**

By increasing the number of points positions by just 2 there is a sizable difference in both Drivers' and Constructors' standings. However, in my opinion, it **does not change** the perception of the driver's performance from a fan's point of view.

Additionally, this simulation of extended points does not factor in strategic decisions that happened because of situations the teams found themselves in with regards to lower points positions (Alex Albon's 57 lap stint in Australia and Mick Schumacher's disastrous Japanese GP being two opposite but extreme examples).

Is it worth having more points paying positions? **Not really.** But it would be pretty cool, nonetheless.

31,zh6fbe,What do people think about this sprint race idea? I'm not convinced but it would be insane!,"This is taken from the most recent Driver61 newsletter (which I love!) in relation to the Sprint race format and how it might be improved. 

""So here are my solutions that nobody asked for: 

Qualifying on Friday sets the grid for the Sunday race proper - that is locked in. The Sprint race starts in the reverse order of that Qualifying and points are given to the top 8 (as they are now). 

We have seen it time and again when faster cars have to come through the field, we get more exciting racing and more jeopardy. This would also give the lower teams a great chance at points and showcase their driver's abilities without costing them on a Sunday if they were to collide. It also makes the top teams work harder for a point or two that could make the difference in a championship, compared to prioritising finishing for the race on Sunday.

- Jack Brabham is the only driver to win a championship with a team bearing his name.

- The winner's prize in the 1964 Belgian GP was a brand new Renault 4. A very fitting car for a motorsport legend like Jim Clark.

[https://www.leemckenzie.tv/writing/inside-f1-published-october-5-2022](https://www.leemckenzie.tv/writing/inside-f1-published-october-5-2022)

I just heard a bit about it on the Race's Seb Vettel podcast episode here:

[https://open.spotify.com/episode/7COFPFcLrllTY2CNxLeBhb?si=ed49773219cb4e2f](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7COFPFcLrllTY2CNxLeBhb?si=ed49773219cb4e2f)  


I've heard McKenzie as a broadcaster for years, and some fans might know her from her interviews with Seb - the ""everyone's a Ferrari fan"", the ""wear the red dress"" interviews. 

The book is basically her life in F1 but structured in chapters that profile the big name drivers she's worked with in her time - Michael Schumacher (on Mercedes return); Lewis Hamilton; Jenson Button; Sebastian Vettel; Felipe Massa, and Max Verstappen.

I picked it up on Audible, and am half way through Chapter 3 on Seb, having done Michael and Lewis first. 

It's not intended to be a technical insight like Newey or Ross Brawn's books, but more a fly on the wall for how the journalists interact with F1 drivers. The really good incident she discusses for example, which some will remember well, is from 2011 where Lewis joked that he was so often off to the stewards because he was black - a shitstorm erupted that wasn't her fault but she copped death threats, Lewis did, Anthony Hamilton was furious, etc.

Curious if anyone else has read it, thoughts, and if anyone is interested - can we recommend it. I am enjoying it so far but only got it yesterday so I can't give you enough insight into the overall thing.","Lee McKenzie's book - Inside F1 - discussion On 5 October this year, Channel 4 UK journalist and F1 stalwart Lee McKenzie published her book, Inside F1:

**Today's random F1 facts:**

^Daily ^Facts ^by ^/u/Fart_Leviathan

- A number of F1 drivers have won 24 hour races, but none comes close to the achievement of Helmut Marko and Gérard Larrousse who won the *86* Hours of Nürburgring endurance race in 1970. For good measure, Helmut won a support race just before the 4 day marathon and flew off to Sweden to finish 2nd in another race just one day after the finish.

- The only name shared by two F1 drivers without distinction is Jacques Villeneuve, as both the 1997 WDC and his uncle ran under that name.

- Slick tyres were introduced at the 1971 Spanish GP.

38,ze5sfp,Have F2 and F3 achieved the polar opposite of what they were supposed to?,"I remember back in 2005 when the GP2 series was introduced as a chance for new drivers to prove what they were capable of in a ""fair"" environment (the team shouldn't matter) and with less money than required for before.

Fast-forward to today and what teams a driver's in matters a lot in F2. Driving a full season even in F3 is much more expensive than in any of the series driver used to go to try to jump into F1. 

The only thing stopping the grid from being 100% pay drivers are the Academies, but do we really want every single talented driver who enters F1 to be already linked to one team from years before his arrival? There are only so many academies and so many drivers each of them can take. Let's be real: how many of the great drivers of the last two decades would have been able to make it to F1 in the current environment? How many Alonsos and Hamiltons could we have lost to this F3-F2 golden ladder?","Have F2 and F3 achieved the polar opposite of what they were supposed to?

39,zexnht,Testing in offseason,"Hello F1 fans, I have noticed on Charles Leclerc’s Instagram story that he was in his F1 car (old or new idk?) at Fiorano Circuit (Ferrari’s own circuit), and one question came into my mind: 

Are F1 teams allowed to test their cars outside of the season apart from the 2 F1 Testing that were at the start of the year in Barcelona and Bahrain? 

After some research I found out in a post from 2 years ago that teams are not allowed to do testing but they have 100km of ‘promotional driving’, sort of filming days. I need some clarifications if anyone has the knowledge for it. 

Have the rules changed? Are they testing the old 2022 or the new car 2023? If they are not allowed to test what could Charles be doing in his car? 

Cheers!","Testing in offseason Hello F1 fans, I have noticed on Charles Leclerc’s Instagram story that he was in his F1 car (old or new idk?) at Fiorano Circuit (Ferrari’s own circuit), and one question came into my mind:

40,zdza8d,The Michael Schumacher Era steamrolled some of the top F1 talents.,"Kimi Raikkonen, Juan Pablo Montoya, Ralf Schumacher (Williams - BMW days), and others when seen in isolation were awesome drivers but just because their initial years overlapped with Michael's peak, all of them ended with no Drivers Championship. True Kimi got it later but that was after Michael and that too from the same team which Michael left.

Even Alonso's early years were eclipsed by Michael. I wonder if the same could be said about Hamilton's domination era. Max was the only consistent challenger outside Mercedes, so not many careers challenged. Hamilton is the good person here. :)","The Michael Schumacher Era steamrolled some of the top F1 talents.

43,zeyruo,"Problem with order, received a different thing","Hi all!

&#x200B;

During the black friday sale I ordered a Ferrari Team tee size XS to finally have my first merch from F1. Well, It arrived yesterday and to my surprise I got a RedBull Polo size L. 

Now, I sent an email and didn't get one back. Which is fine, it has only been a day but I want to exchange it asap. Also I can't get through their online help chat, since the reason i'm contacting them isn't really for retour. It just says ""unavailable for the moment"".

&#x200B;

Has this ever happened to anyone, or was I just unlucky? Also if i'm taking the contact approach properly. Might have missed something but this is all I know to do.

To ease my pain im telling myself they probably saw that it's an order to the Netherlands and were like ""99% it's a RedBull fan guy for a polo"".","Problem with order, received a different thing Hi all!

44,zf151h,Losial (Qatar) is actually a decent place to host a race (racing wise ONLY),"Now I know that the circuit itself may not be very pleasing and good. But it still produced some really decent racing in 2021. Which is why I titled the post. For the keyboard warriors who want to drag the human rights issue into this, please read the title again, I am talking racing-wise only, i.e the on-track action. 

For those who disagree, here are a few points:

1. Alonso Podium: He had been looking quite pacy before too, but this time he actually made it materialize into a great podium result. He was consistent all weekend round. 
2. Checo's Charge: Those who remember this remember it fondly. When it was a straight-up battle between Alonso and Checo for third place, Red Bull put Checo on a two-stopper. What followed was an amazing display of overtakes, with him making an epic 37 passes, and giving us good battles with the likes of Esteban Ocon. 
3. Tyre and safety car Drama: Latifi, Bottas, and Russell all suffered punctures and wing damage in the race, bringing out the VSC and spicing things up for the aforementioned Checo overtaking masterclass. 
4. Pierre Gasly: He started 2nd, raced hard, eventually lost out to faster cars, and ended up 11th. 

Sounds familiar doesn't it?   


Yes!   


Spa 2022 was an exact replica:   


1. Spaniard on the podium in both races (Sainz came third at Spa)
2. A driver on a charge (Max won from 14th)
3. Safety Car Drama: Lewis and Alonso's crash, and Latifi spinning Bottas out brought out the safety car and started a huge drama
4. Lewis Hamiton: Started quite highly, had incidents, then dropped out of the points, then retired just like Gasly at Qatar.

46,zd5dwd,The naming of formula 1 cars,"I have watched every race going all the way back to 1992, and been on different boards for the last 15 years, yet there is one thing that always makes me feel like a complete noob.
I cannot for the life of me remember the names given to each car.

Sure, there are some easy ones. I love how Toyota named their cars. The TF109 was clear and easy to understand. Toyota Formula 1 2009.
Same with some of the Ferrari's. Say the Ferrari F2007.
However. Each time I come across a discussion regarding their favorite car, or the most dominant car etc. all these different names pop up.
Williams FW16, McLaren MP4-19, Red Bull RB18, Mercedes W05 and on and on.
I seriously have to google the names every single time just to understand what car they are talking about. 
The odd time someone straight up says something like ""the most dominant car is clearly the 1992 Williams"" is a small but welcome blessing to me.

Does anyone else also struggle with this?

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

51,zd1v0b,Suspension generated power,"I saw this on YouTube and it may be a gimmick, but ai was wondering if f1 uses suspension generated power.

I know the ERS( energy recover system) uses exhaust gases to generate power also known as MGU-H and braking, MGUK. 
I'm not super technical, but I believe both of these powers recharge a battery that can be later deployed for instance to make a fast lap in qualy or defend/overtake.

Would this suspension generated power be an option? Specially in bumpy Street circuits, and we all saw how much the cars were jumping this year with all that porpoising. 

I'll leave a link to the video:

53,zb5207,Just finished rewatching the ‘07 season…..,"For the first time since it actually aired, I rewatched almost the entire ‘07 season and I was reminded what a wild ride it was. Particularly, just how close Hamilton was to winning his rookie season. 

Everyone seems to collectively agree that China is where Hamilton blows his championship, but I actually have a different take. Yea, he blows China, but the only reason China blows it for him is because he made the dumbest decision of possibly his racing career a few months earlier. 

The European GP at Germany is one of the most notable races of the season, mostly because it’s batshit crazy. The off and on rain, 6 cars spinning out in the same corner, and most importantly….Hamilton taking dry tires about 5 laps too early. This fucking madlad threw away a solid chance at points after ALL the previous shit, notably spinning out among 5 other cars and getting the crane to dig him out for “safety reasons,” just to be the Guinea pig for dry tires at an absurd point in the race. If he made it to 7th that race he wins the championship his rookie year. 

Tl;dr Hamilton coulda won ‘07 with just a little fuckin common sense at Nurburgring.","Just finished rewatching the ‘07 season…..

**Today's random F1 facts:**

^Daily ^Facts ^by ^/u/Fart_Leviathan

- Force India scored a pole position before ever scoring a point. 

- The closest ever Formula 1 finish was recorded at Monza in 1971 when Peter Gethin won by 0.01s from Ronnie Peterson. The top five finishers were covered by just 0.61s.

- Ricardo Zunino started his F1 career after Niki Lauda's sudden retirement during qualifying for the 1979 Canadian GP meant Brabham had to look for a driver in the audience via the track's PA system. Zunino, being an F2 driver meaning he was qualified to drive the car, got the gig and brought it home in 7th.

56,zc7w46,Should F1 try out DRS-seconds?,"With the new regulations the famous question arose once again this season; should F1 stop using DRS. 

Often, regular F1-watchers can predict when an overtake is going to happen. We just know that when a driver get's within one second of the car ahead they will be able to breeze past. 

As a result of DRS, drivers with a speed advantage can complete overtakes often already halfway down the straight. However, completely eliminating DRS might lead to uneventful races. 

What if DRS would become a tool for strategy instead of just a way to make overtaking easier? 

The idea is simple: 

* Every driver get's X seconds of DRS per race. 
* They can use it whenever they want. Drivers don't have to be within one second of the car ahead to use DRS. 
* DRS can still only be used when within a DRS-zone. 
* Drivers can choose themselves for how many seconds they activate DRS while within the DRS-zone. 

I see multiple advantages to this approach:

* **Fairer races:** every driver get's the same amount of seconds. No more disadvantages for defending drivers. 
* **More spectacular overtakes:** Drivers would want to use a minimum amount of seconds to complete overtakes. Overtakes already completed halfway down the straight would become a rare sight. 
* **More exciting battles:** drivers can use DRS to defend. Making battles more unpredictable. 
* **Better strategy:** Drivers would use DRS as a strategic tool to make undercuts, overcuts, or attacks for the fastest lap work. They have to time the use of DRS to get the most optimal result. 

I'm interested to hear what you think?

57,zarb41,How do you think Formula 1 will look in 2052,"I've been watching Formula for at least 30 years. The first F1 Champion I remember hearing about was Nigel Mansell, so I'm using that as a benchmark.

Since 1992, Formula 1 has gone through a number of changes due to societal evolution, political will, and technological advancements.

In the next 30 years or so, what changes are we expected to see in F1.

For example, could there be some tracks which are no longer able to hold a race due to flooding from climate change?

Could there be a point where oil sponsorship is outlawed like tobacco sponsorship has been?

Will see a female F1 Champion as a result of some of the women in motorsport initiatives which are being encouraged?

In 30 years time will the power units run on petrol?

These are just some of the things I've been thinking about. I'm sure that there is a lot more.","How do you think Formula 1 will look in 2052 I've been watching Formula for at least 30 years. The first F1 Champion I remember hearing about was Nigel Mansell, so I'm using that as a benchmark.

58,zatg6p,Formula 1 2022 Championship standings if they were based purely on race pace,"I run a neural network for each race to predict average lap times based on the lap number, tire wear, and tire compound.

Then I compared these times with each driver's lap times and ranked the drivers based on the average difference to the predicted time.

I excluded laps with yellow flags, pit stop in-lap, pit stop out-lap, and the last lap as it was often slower than usual and took care of laps on which the car would retire.

**Note:** Monaco excluded. Lack of overtakes, Alonso and Perez trains, etc., would skew the calculations. It would make Albon the fastest car on the track :)

59,z9xu00,Widespread misunderstanding of 'reverse DRS' due to Motorsport.com's misinterpretation of Brawn's comments,"Regarding this article posted a few hours ago: https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1s-active-aero-plans-for-2026-could-include-reverse-drs/10406751/

In the article, Ross Brawn is quoted as saying

> If you have active aerodynamics, then of course you could affect the car in front. You could have a proximity [that] once you get within a certain degree, the car in front loses a little bit of downforce and you gain a little bit of downforce.

Motorsport.com interpreted and reported that comment as applying to race leaders, which suggests a video game-type rubber-banding effect.  I think it's extremely obvious that is NOT what Ross Brawn meant, if you focus on the quotes and ignore the rest of the article.  Brawn is talking about two cars in a fight. Currently, the car in front always has more drag but also more downforce, so they can use subtraction of drag for the car behind to make up for the loss of performance when following. But for 2026 they're talking about adding active aero so that *all* cars can reduce their drag in a manner similar to the way DRS currently works. In that case, the only way to have a DRS-like effect might be to either add some drag to the car in front or reduce its downforce. The idea is not about rubber-banding the entire field, but instead minimizing the penalty for following.  That's the same goal of the current DRS system, and the same goal of the 2022 technical regulations change.  But the addition of active aero might require and/or enable them to use different or more nuanced (e.g. variable based on proximity rather than set track zones with detection points) methods.

tl;dr: It's not about rubber-banding, it's an alternative (edit: *potential* alternative) to DRS for cars that are fighting, wherever they are in the order.","Widespread misunderstanding of 'reverse DRS' due to Motorsport.com's misinterpretation of Brawn's comments Regarding this article posted a few hours ago: https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1s-active-aero-plans-for-2026-could-include-reverse-drs/10406751/

60,z9kxip,Who will be worst driver on the grid in 2023?,"The last few years, it’s been fairly easy to identify who would be worst during the off-season.  No offense to his supporters but I think most people would have rightly guessed that Latifi was going to spend the year at the back of the pack.  Mazepin wasn’t hard to spot previously.  

With 3 rookies on the grid, they are obvious early candidates.  Especially, Sargeant given the Williams handicap. Hard to picture Piastri being slowest in the McLaren but de Vries in the AT is possible, I guess.  

Or will it be a non-rookie.  Zhou and Tsunoda arguably both have some work to do to prove they belong. Could either slip to the bottom?

While there is guaranteed to be a last place driver in 2023, who that driver will be is more speculative than it has been the past few years.  Who would you place your bet on if you had to?","Who will be worst driver on the grid in 2023? The last few years, it’s been fairly easy to identify who would be worst during the off-season.

61,zblffr,Regional travel ideas,"This was a comment on a FB group, not mine.

I like the idea...

I was throwing around an idea with my son about breaking up the F1 championship into 3 segments.  Having travel consolidated by region like you’re saying.  Maybe do a N and S America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

Now for each one of the regions have a regional championship so the teams get extra points for winning that championship and add to the existing season total.  That gives a team that maybe struggled for a while but then came on strong an opportunity to make up points if needed.

Obviously there’s a lot of factors and details to be figured out, but I thought it might make it pretty exciting","Regional travel ideas This was a comment on a FB group, not mine.

64,z9vnov,Potentially stupid question: Would you consider IndyCar and Super Formula to be on the same tier?,"If you were to create a pyramid of open-wheel racing series, with the F1 World Drivers’ Championship obviously at the top, would IndyCar and Super Formula be together in the 2nd tier? Would any other series be there?

I’ve never watched Super Formula, but doing some small research into it, it seems similar on the surface to IndyCar - both award national championships to their winners and are considered the top regional open-wheel series in their parts of the world.

The level of competition in IndyCar seems to be higher, but I’m not sure by how much. Both series attract many international drivers (IndyCar moreso), and both series have generated successful F1 drivers (i.e. Jacques Villeneuve coming from IndyCar or Ralf Schumacher coming from Super Formula). What are your thoughts?","Potentially stupid question: Would you consider IndyCar and Super Formula to be on the same tier?

66,z9aavx,Why is Vasseur is looked at as a poor replacement for Binotto ?,"With Binottos exit there have been article after article touting possible replacements. In most of them Vassuer is not really rated highly and I'm scratching my head as to why that is the case. If  I was in charge of selection his appointment makes the most sense as a **realistic** replacement (no, Horner is not going to leave the team he helped build, Wolff is not going to leave a team he partially owns and Brawn is close to 70 so I doubt he wants to travel 23 weekends a year).  

Vasseur has decent qualifications, he helped build Arte GP from scratch into a good GP2 team, has had a decent run at a budget constrained Sauber and through the Sauber-Ferrari collaboration he isn't exactly a stranger to the inner workings of the team. His current resume of  experience is actually a lot more well rounded than Binotto's when he was given that role.

67,zb0dz1,Colin Kolles would be a good Tram Principal with the cost cap.,"Kolles has a reputation of getting the most bang for the buck with his budget and with the cost cap he could be an asset for a team looking for a team principal(Ferrari).

Look at his WEC team. Every year theres question about the team being able to race at Le Mans but he pulls of miracles and gets the finding to run the team from sponsors. Now i dont know who the sponsors are since the cars are usually sponsor less but his secret sponsors can’t be worse than rich energy or crypto’s. Okay maybe the only way it can be worse if theres fraud or money laundering involved.

70,z93q88,Spa Grad Prix 2023 Camping Prices,"tl:dr: camping prices increased by more than 100%

Hi,

just checked and prices for the Spa Grad Prix Camping area and nearly got a stroke: 

This year the prices are just outrageous. You can see them [here](https://www.spagrandprix.com/en/tickets-camping-green). 


- 4 persons 20qm went from 145€ last year -> to 400€ 

- 8 persons 70qm went from 290€ last year -> to 700€ (last year 80qm for 290€) 


No logic behind these prices, I know, inflation is real but cmon. 


Last year we went with 10 persons and got 2x 40qm. It‘s fine but setting up tents had to be planned well. We wanted to get one extra spot for 145€ (total of 3 spaces -> 120qm, 3 cars + tents + chill area).


But with these prices we are considering not going at all. A price increases of 100+% is just outrageous. 


You can „save money“ (lol) by getting 1x 40qm for 4 persons (400€) instead of 1x 40qm 5 persons (=450€). How can they even check it? 

This whole thing is a cheap moneygrab. 

Keep in mind, showers are 5€ per use, no electricity nor water on the site :)


Your thoughts? Did the prices of other GP camping go up too?","Spa Grad Prix 2023 Camping Prices tl:dr: camping prices increased by more than 100%

76,z9dllm,"(My Opinion, scroll down if you see this as boring) Next Ferrari Team Principal and Technical Director","If you have been living under a rock, Ferrari accepted the resignation of Mattia Binotto. Mattia has been working as both a Team Principal and Technical Director. Being both an Horner/Wolff and Newey/Allison. Now that he is gone COMPLETELY (from Ferrari), 2 very important roles are now vacant. You need really good people on this roles to have a very good team. Can't have a bad Team Principal, we just saw that in the Ferrari Hybrid Era (Please stop making Arrivabene look good, he's just more political than Mattia, aside from that I would rather have Binotto as TP.). Can't have a bad Technical Director (Can't have an example because before Binotto, Mercedes' James Allison is their TD, which the both of them are really good.).

&#x200B;

So let's go with the Team Principal first. Let's discuss about the obvious here.

1. Frederic Vasseur - His name has been flying around the rumors and he seems like a good choice. He is more political (I think, at least compared to Mattia), while not a Wolff or a Horner, having a separate TP and TD is much better so that they can focus on the other work. You also want Vasseur in Ferrari if you want to keep Charles after 2024. There have been rumors that Charles would leave Ferrari once his 2024 contract expires. This WILL be bad for Ferrari, losing the only driver who could fight Max and Lewis, without any possible replacement as Mick looks like he won't go to Ferrari. Their nearest talent is Oliver Bearman who fought for the F3 title in his rookie season, but he needs to be VERY good at F2 or win the WDC in his rookie season for me to think he would replace Charles. But Lando is very good and WDC material, so maybe not winning the WDC in their rookie season is fine. Just make sure he is in the Top 3 and near the title then maybe promote to F1 in HAAS or Sauber before they become Audi. (Say what you want about HAAS and hating rookies, all Ferrari needs to do is come with a big chunk of moola and more support from Maranello, but there is one problem and I will be addressing it at the TD section of this very long post)
2. Laurent Mekies - Although we haven't seen if Laurent would be better than Mattia as while he was seen as the TP when Binotto was at the factory, he has limited authority as he was only the deputy. But as the head of trackside operations, he was basically the 2nd most powerful person in the Scuderia, and he couldn't help Ferrari as Rueda basically answers to him before Mattia. I don't know if he would be better than Vasseur or the other possible candidate I might propose, but if you want stability in the Scuderia, he is the choice.
3. Antonello Coletta - Basically the outsider of the three as he has 0 F1 experience, he is part of the Ferrari as the head of their GT and Competizione operations so he has experience. People would probably downplay him because of his lack of F1 experience, but Jean Todt didn't have F1 experience. Coletta is probably the opposite of Mattia, on which I have heard (so please do not quote me on this) is harsh on employees and give 0 fucks about them. So he would probably return the blame game Mattia tried to remove. Although I can't find a reliable source and I am fairly new to the WEC world. He could fire Rueda but I don't know. He is part of Ferrari so more chance imo.

&#x200B;

Now onto the 2 possible candidates for the Technical Director. (I only see 2 possibility with 1 pretty much the more likely one.)

1. Simone Resta - Let us start with the more likely one. Simone Resta is the current Technical Director for HAAS, he is there because of the budget cap and that they basically didn't need him for the F1-75 project as Rory Bryne and Mattia Binotto took charge in the car. Let's be honest, Resta's chassis intelligence, Binotto's engine intelligence, and Bryne's knowledge would probably be the best engineering trio (Except Newey, he has the brain of 3 smart ass people), although FIA said 'budget cap' and Ferrari loaned him to HAAS, it was basically a win-win situation. HAAS gets a great engineer, Ferrari doesn't lose a great engineer to a rival team. His brilliance has been shown with the 2022 HAAS VF-22, for a team with a tight budget, he made a great car, unfortunately he couldn't develop it because of how restricted the money is (also Mick's crashes didn't really help.). The only setback this could give is that Enrico Cardile has been the head of Chassis, their engine would not be as powerful and the chassis department could have 2 leaders which isn't good at Ferrari.
2. Aldo Costa - I have seen his name flying around the TD position. He has been in Ferrari before so there is a working relationship, but like James Allison, he jumped to Mercedes. He could come back. I don't know a lot about him so let's just leave it there.

(Damn, the longest post I have ever typed. This is all opinion and might be wrong in the near future.)","(My Opinion, scroll down if you see this as boring) Next Ferrari Team Principal and Technical Director If you have been living under a rock, Ferrari accepted the resignation of Mattia Binotto.

81,z6tp6l,Too much credit given to new rookies.,"Just before I start, this is just personal opinion, so feel free to disagree!

Ok, let us take a short view back to the past where Felipe Nasr joined Sauber in 2015.  As a surprise replacement, expectations were low. However, he managed to get a 5th place on his first race in a underperforming Sauber. While he never was able to achieve such a high position once more, he consistently beat his teammate Ericsson, and managed to finish 13th in that championship.

Another example of a rookie surprising everyone is Pascal Wehrlein. While his points tally seems lacking, he beat every teammate and consistently performed well with the worst car on the grid. 

What links these two is that they were both given the boot after 2 years of racing, even after thrashing their teammates and showing massive potential. Schumacher now has been removed from the haas lineup after 2 years but everyone seems to be incensed beyond belief, however has he really shown the same potential as the aforementioned drivers?

He’s had two mediocre (and expensive) seasons and for a team like Haas honestly they don’t need a young driver, how can they help a young driver when they themselves are in disarray. 

Also, has Guanyu Zhou been that great. Honestly, I don’t see much potential in him as while the Alfa hasn’t been amazing, he seems to be on the same level as Gio when he was at Alfa. But for now he’s not been expensive and his results aren’t horrendous

But when Nasr and Wehrlein didn’t get signed on to their respective team, there was never such an uproar as there was with Schumacher. I get that he’s a Schumacher which can make people biased but for me he’s just like another Bruno Senna.

What do you think?

**Today's random F1 facts:**

^Daily ^Facts ^by ^/u/Fart_Leviathan

- Eddie Jordan intended to name his first F1 car the Jordan 911. Porsche did not like the idea, so Eddie came up with a deal that he changes the name if he got a brand new Porsche Carrera. The parties eventually agreed on a year's loan free of charge.

- Both Graham Hill and Damon hill finished 11th in their final race for Brabham, 20 years apart.

- Sergio Perez holds the record for most races before his first win. He won the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix - his 190th race start.

83,z6qu3i,"Max interview with Viaplay - ""I'll be here until atleat 2028"".","So I just watched the post season interview Max did with Viaplay.

Here is the summary (just the points that were slightly interesting):

* Max showed up in shorts and a white t-shirt.

* They talked about Alonso, If he plans to be in F1 in his 40s too like him. ""No, definitely not"" he said immediately. By that time he would not be racing anymore, not in F1 atleast, because there are a lot of other things in life he wants to enjoy. He also complained that there are way too much races per season right now for him to enjoy F1 later on in life. He said he will be here for sure untill 2028, he will be 31 then, he will see what happens then he said.

* He doesn't care to break any more records, it would be nice he says, he hopes to add more championships to his record, but if it ends here, he is satisfied. He said it's not a given to ever get another season like this again, with so many wins either. He just hopes they will keep having a car that can win races, that's what it's all about for him.

* Asked about the drama in Brazil. He said he really doesn't care about the online hate for him and how intense people get on social nowadays, he doesn't let the hate towards him personally, affect him. He said those people arguing online have no clue what sort of stuff goes on behind closed doors in F1, and there's a lot going on. Apparently a lot of hate gets send to his family and girlfriend, that's what he doesn't like. He also said that he is a teamplayer. He said he and GP are very good in setting up the car, and that always gets copied by the other side of the garage, which he is happy to do, but doesn't have to. He wasn't asked for his reasons why he did what he did in Brazil, he said that if he explained, people wouldn't understand anyway.



Edit: forgot to mention this one

* During the Monza weekend Max had dinner with Nyck de Vries to give him some tips for the race. He told him to just call up Marko and ask for a spot on the team. Nyck said ""what, seriously?"". Max said ""Yea, just call him and ask, he will appreciate that"". So Nyck did, and look where he is now.


Pretty awful interview btw, the woman doing the interview didn't really deliver. Bad questions, interview didn't flow well at all. She would ask him stupid stuff like what he thought about Lewis his fashion show every weekend and such. You could clearly see he wasn't comfortable.

85,z77v7g,The F1 Calendar Rated by Freedom Index,"**Rating the 2023 F1 Calendar by Freedom Index**

When the 24-race calendar was announced for next year late September, many people were not only worried about the length of the season, but of course also about the many nations holding a race that probably should not.

This year we had of course the race in Russia canceled due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, we did see rockets impacting about 10 kilometers from the racetrack, sparking discussions as to whether we should even be racing in Saudi-Arabia.

As we all know, to the FIA, the most important factor in deciding where to race is money. Next year this will not be different. 

Currently many people are witnessing the mess that is the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, a country known for its human rights violations. Having allegedly caused the death of about 6500 ‘slaves’ this is just one example of oil money buying sports events and sports washing.

I decided to find an objective measurement to find out the freedom in the countries on the 2023 calendar. I included China since it is not yet cancelled.

**The Results**

https://preview.redd.it/vgj4xw8x6r2a1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5f89d87efdc64bf9dbe6644087dc370a8a45d0f

The results are not very surprising, if we sort from best to worst, we see Canada take the first spot with a total of 98/100 points, taking the full 40/40 in political freedom and 58/60 in the civil freedom section.

Going further down the list we come across many ‘Western’ countries, I’m including Japan in the Western countries here. While it is culturally more similar to Asia, politically and economically it has historically aligned with the West since 1945. 

We can see the scores go down drastically as we leave Europe and the America’s. Here we can also see the world average as a clear divide between those countries and Asia and the Middle East.

Qatar actually scores the highest out of all these countries, which I found surprising to say the least. From here on out it gets worse quickly. Since they are all ruled by either a royal family or in China’s case a single political party, they score very few points here. With China even going below 0 for their severe human rights violations and cultural assimilation in Tibet etc.

Just for fun I also added the Racefans.net race ratings to my table, for countries with multiple circuits I took the average (excluding Las Vegas and Miami). This is a community vote and has been running for several years. This sadly doesn’t really give us a solid sporting reason to outright stop racing in these countries that score so low. Races like Baku and Bahrain have rather high ratings. It should be said though, that the places with the worst human rights scores also have the lowest race scores, i.e. Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. 

**What does all of this tell us?**

Well, nothing we didn’t know already. Having a race in some desert place where women are seen as lesser people, LGBTQ+ people are murdered, and journalists have to fear for their lives is obviously bad. You didn’t need to read this post to know that. I really wanted to post how awful the situation in some of these countries is. We can only hope that in the coming years the situation improves as gas and oil get traded in for more sustainable alternatives, and we can just have races without having to worry about the places we visit.

Currently many people are witnessing the mess that is the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, a country known for its human rights violations. Having allegedly caused the death of about 6500 ‘slaves’ this is just one example of oil money buying sports events and sports washing.

I decided to find an objective measurement to find out the freedom in the countries on the 2023 calendar. I included China since it is not yet cancelled.

**The Results**

https://preview.redd.it/vgj4xw8x6r2a1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5f89d87efdc64bf9dbe6644087dc370a8a45d0f

The results are not very surprising, if we sort from best to worst, we see Canada take the first spot with a total of 98/100 points, taking the full 40/40 in political freedom and 58/60 in the civil freedom section.

Going further down the list we come across many ‘Western’ countries, I’m including Japan in the Western countries here. While it is culturally more similar to Asia, politically and economically it has historically aligned with the West since 1945. 

We can see the scores go down drastically as we leave Europe and the America’s. Here we can also see the world average as a clear divide between those countries and Asia and the Middle East.

Qatar actually scores the highest out of all these countries, which I found surprising to say the least. From here on out it gets worse quickly. Since they are all ruled by either a royal family or in China’s case a single political party, they score very few points here. With China even going below 0 for their severe human rights violations and cultural assimilation in Tibet etc.

Just for fun I also added the Racefans.net race ratings to my table, for countries with multiple circuits I took the average (excluding Las Vegas and Miami). This is a community vote and has been running for several years. This sadly doesn’t really give us a solid sporting reason to outright stop racing in these countries that score so low. Races like Baku and Bahrain have rather high ratings. It should be said though, that the places with the worst human rights scores also have the lowest race scores, i.e. Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. 

**What does all of this tell us?**

Well, nothing we didn’t know already. Having a race in some desert place where women are seen as lesser people, LGBTQ+ people are murdered, and journalists have to fear for their lives is obviously bad. You didn’t need to read this post to know that. I really wanted to post how awful the situation in some of these countries is. We can only hope that in the coming years the situation improves as gas and oil get traded in for more sustainable alternatives, and we can just have races without having to worry about the places we visit.

89,z6z3cq,How effective were the new regulations in 2022?,"Whilst Max ran away with this seasons championship, the first with these new regulations, I wanted to see how effective the new cars were at promoting closer racing - which was one of the main aims of the new regulations.

To do this, I wanted to compare overtaking data from this seasons races with races from 2021; to see just how effective the new regulations were. With tracks where there were no races in 2021, I have compared data with the last race held there (2019).

There are a few caveats with this data, like Japan this year where we only had half a race, and Singapore and Monaco this year were wet races, and Australia have made changes to the track since F1 last raced there. (Miami was excluded as there's no historical data)

But overall, number of overtakes per race increased by 25% on average from 2021, with tracks such as Hungary, Belgium, Monza, COTA and Austria seeing the biggest increases in overtaking. 

However it is worth noting that 2022 has the same number of average overtakes per race as 2019 and 2014, and less than the average overtakes for 2016 (52), 2013 (54), 2012 (61) and 2011 (65).

With tracks races 2021 , I compared data last race held ( 2019 ) . |Race|Overtakes Previous|Overtakes 2022|Difference ( % ) | | : -| : -| : -| : -| |Bahrain|75|78|\+4 % | |Saudi Arabia|27|32|\+18 % | |Australia|12 ( 2019 , Old layout ) |34|\+183 % | |Emilia-Romagna|42\ * |23\ * |\-45 % | |Spain|51|48|\-5 % | |Monaco|0|13\ * || |Azerbaijan|27|23|\-14 % | |Canada|30 ( 2019 ) |35|\+16 % | |Britain|29|31|\+6 % | |Austria|38|68|\+78 % | |France|60|34|\-43 % | |Hungary|17\ * |62|\+264 % | |Belgium|32 ( 2020 ) |75|\+134 % | |Netherlands|24|24|0 % | |Italy|23|58|\+152 % | |Singapore|59 ( 2019 ) |16\ * |\-73 % | |Japan|58 ( 2019 ) |28\ * |\-52 % | |USA|32|83|\+159 % | |Mexico|23|24|\+4 % | |Brazil|65|77|\+18 % | |Abu Dhabi|36|79|\+84 % | |Average|36|45|\+25 % | \ * = wet race There caveats data , like Japan year half race , Singapore Monaco year wet races , Australia made changes track since F1 last raced . ( Miami excluded 's historical data ) But overall , number overtakes per race increased 25 % average 2021 , tracks Hungary , Belgium , Monza , COTA Austria seeing biggest increases overtaking . However worth noting 2022 number average overtakes per race 2019 2014 , less average overtakes 2016 ( 52 ) , 2013 ( 54 ) , 2012 ( 61 ) 2011 ( 65 ) . So whilst new era cars still developed , appears drivers follow closely previous years , overall impact racing yet seen ."

Here are some of my main reservations that I think prevent me from fully enjoying the sport. I'm hoping someone could lend me their perspectives on these:

1. For those that don't support Red Bull/Mercedes/Ferrari, it seems that (at least in recent years) your team doesn't come close to winning the championship. What fun is watching then? I remember getting tired of the NBA's warriors-cavaliers monopoly, but at least it wasn't as prolonged as team-monopolies tend to be in F1. How are you excited about a new season when the championship is only being fought between 2 teams on a grid of 10?
2. I think the main reason I don't fully enjoy it is cuz i'm not immersed in the technical/physics side. Most tend to be drawn to that aspect more than the actual racing. Any advice on how you guys learned more about that side? At the moment, the races for me are just cars trying to overtake one another but ik there's a lot more underlying complexity than that.
3. How did you decide which team/driver to support? And do you support a team (+ its associated drivers) *or* a driver (+ its associated team)?

95,z5z0hs,There has only been 1 driver to ever have an official fastest lap who has never scored a point. Meet Brian Henton.,"No, Mazepin does not have a fastest lap, despite Spa 2021. You cant set a fastest lap behind the SC. That ""race"" has no fastest lap according to all official records.

[Brian Henton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Henton) had a fairly anonymous career in F1, although was F3 and Euro F2 champion before joining F1.  
He started in 1975 with a few races for the illustrious Lotus in just his 3rd year of open wheel racing but the car was on a big drop off from previous seasons and he only had a few appearences which went nowhere for the team. He only did sporadic race weekends for various backmarker teams for a few years, almost never getting through qualifying (not unusual at the time, 30-40 drivers would enter a weekend and usually half of them failed to qualify). In 1978 it looked as though his career had ended as he was never given a consistent drive and 1979 and 1980 he couldnt find a team at all.

Finally in 1981 after years bouncing around he got a full season with Toleman alongside Derek Warwick. Both drivers were far, far off the pace and Henton only qualified for 2 races that year, including a 10th place at Monza, although he was 3 laps down and in last place.

In what was the most unpredictable season in F1 history, for 1982 he started in Arrows but quickly moved to Tyrrell and finally after many years of failing to qualify he had a car that could actually get into races and proved quite reliable for the era. His teammate Michele Alboreto had far more success withb 7 points finishes including a unlikely win in the final race of the season in a car park in Vegas.
Brian started all 13 remaining races of the 1982 season with a few top 10 finishes (although only top 6 scored points during this era) in comparison.  
  
In the famous 1982 Monaco race he classified as 8th place, 4 laps down although he was actually still running at the end of the race, one of only 5 cars able to cross the finish line.

Finally we get to Brands Hatch for the British GP. Starting 17th on the grid was not unusual for Brian that year. Where the car had an advantage was not in speed but how reliable it was. 

Once again in the race Brian Henton steadily lost time to the leaders but ploughed on through the race near the back of the pack. As was the style at the time, everyone around him kept on retiring and near the end of the race everyone was nursing their car home, 1 lap down to leader Nikki Lauda the unthinkable happened. Brian Henton set a fastest lap. I doubt anybody at the track noticed, but this was truly out of the blue. This was a driver who had a decent qualification the day before by only being 2.5 seconds behind the leaders in a 70 second lap. The car was reasonably fast as Alboreto showed during the season. But Henton was a nobody, and already a lap down.

His laptime of 1:13.0 was 0.6 faster than the previous fastest lap, and despite the track getting quicker near the end of the race and other drivers coming close nobody could deny Brian Henton the honour of becoming the most unlikely fastest lap winner in F1 history.

Sadly for him he still only finished 8th in the race and scored no points.

He was dropped at the end of the year, likely due to his lack of speed and the success of teammate Alboreto showing the car could do well with the right driver. He never raced in F1 again but will continue to hold the dubious honour of being the only driver in history to have more fastest laps than points.","There has only been 1 driver to ever have an official fastest lap who has never scored a point.

**Today's random F1 facts:**

^Daily ^Facts ^by ^/u/Fart_Leviathan

- Alberto Ascari and Jim Clark are the only two drivers to record a Grand Chelem (Pole position, race win, led every lap of the race) in their title-winning race.

- A number of F1 drivers have won 24 hour races, but none comes close to the achievement of Helmut Marko and Gérard Larrousse who won the *86* Hours of Nürburgring endurance race in 1970. For good measure, Helmut won a support race just before the 4 day marathon and flew off to Sweden to finish 2nd in another race just one day after the finish.

- Jack Brabham is the only driver to win a championship with a team bearing his name.

103,z5eaq1,TV direction has always been hilarious (2012),"The last few seasons there has been a ton of talk about how poor TV direction has been (often warranted). I'm rewatching the 2012 season because what else is there to do in the off season, and there were two moments that made me think live TV direction has just always been full of foibles.

1. Maldonado takes out Perez and they are showing the drama, but it's just an interview between Pinkham and Di Resta (who was already out) overlaid on top

2. Webber is catching Alonso for the lead and the commentators are BEGGING for like a solid minute to show some damn video of the lead and we're just forced to keep watching Hulkenberg, Senna and Button battle for 9th for the 5th consecutive minute

Is there any time people can think of when the race direction has been particularly good or is it just all our poor memories fooling us into thinking the past was better?","TV direction has always been hilarious (2012) The last few seasons there has been a ton of talk about how poor TV direction has been (often warranted).

What do you consider to be the strangest coincidences in F1 history?

Here are an few that I thought of:

1) Gerhard Berger not only winning his First and Last grand prix in Benetton, but also giving Benetton their first and last Grand Prix win. In an sense, Berger book-ended his F1 Grand Prix wins for Benetton, while coincidentally, book-ending Benetton's victories.

2) Both American F1 champions(Phil Hill and Mario Andretti) won the title at Monza due to the death of their teammate and the only other that could have overtaken them(Wolfgang Von Trips in 1961 and Ronnie Peterson in 1978)

3) John Watson winning the 1982 Detroit Grand Prix from the 17th starting position, and less than an year later, won the 1983 United States Grand Prix West from the 22nd starting position.

109,z50uu2,Ask /r/formula1 Anything - Daily Discussion - 26 November 2022,"#Welcome to the /r/formula1 Daily Discussion / Q&A thread.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

**Today's random F1 facts:**

^Daily ^Facts ^by ^/u/Fart_Leviathan

- The cockpit of an F1 car can reach temperatures of around 50C during a race.

- An F1 brake disc weighs 1-1.2 kg. A standard sports car brake disc weighs 15 kg.

- A hard wooden strip is fitted to the underside of F1 cars, to check that they are not being run too close to the track surface. Something that is apparent if the wood is excessively worn.
